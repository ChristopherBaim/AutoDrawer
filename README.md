## Auto Drawer
Auto Drawer is a simple freehand drawing tool using mouse automation.
From a source image, it automatically draws a [binary image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_image)
in applications that allow freehand mouse drawing (ex.Windows Paint or [Roll20](https://roll20.net/)).

## Motivation
Online gaming services, like Roll20, often allow users to freehand draw onto maps 
for other players to see. I wanted a way to make decent drawings without requiring
a drawing tablet and artistic skill.
